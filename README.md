Unlocks directories with facial recognition


Personal projet to get familiar with cv2, and image managing in python.


The goal is to finish this project without watchinh any video related to the subject, by only using written documents. I would be to easy otherwise ;-)

If the project is a success, why not try to mix it up mith a little hardware, and try to do a physical lock, working with facial recognition.
